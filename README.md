# computer_vision

This repository contains scripts related to what I learnt about computer vision.

## Programming_Computer_Vision

This folder contains codes from the book **Programming Computer Vision With Python**.

## Theory

This folder contains codes transformed from the theoretical details in the book **Computer Vision**. Those may not be the most efficient approaches, but it indeed trains my ability to convert theories into executable codes.
